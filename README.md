This is a small app to help me get into [three.js](https://threejs.org/). It uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber) so I can interface with Three better.

## Quick Start

Install the dependencies:

```
$ npm i
```

Then start the app:

```
$ npm start
```
